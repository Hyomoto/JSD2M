JS2DM is a JSDoc to Markdown parser for Gamemaker Studio 2.3+ projects. In spite of the name, JSD2M derives context from the files themselves. Thus if no JSDoc is provided, it will still interpret your project as best it can. The output is a page for each constructor, function and object in the project, as well as a table of contents. It supports the normal JSDoc comments that GMS already allows, plus adds a few new ones to meet the needs of 2.3's constructors.
